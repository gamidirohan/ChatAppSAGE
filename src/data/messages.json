Here's how you can structure the extraction:\n\n1. **Identify the Data Structure**: The context consists of three JSON objects, each representing a message with varying levels of detail.\n\n2. **Determine the Query Method**: Depending on the type of database (relational, NoSQL, graph), use the appropriate query language. For example, in a graph database like Neo4j, use Cypher to match all nodes and return their properties.\n\n3. **Extract All Fields**: Ensure you include all relevant fields such as `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `message`, and `sent_time`.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: Present the data in the desired format, likely JSON as per the context.\n\nHere's an example of how the extracted data might look in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"summary\": \"A JSON-formatted message from sender ID 1 to receiver ID 'sage' asking about recent promotions, sent on April 13, 2025, at 13:56:46.860Z.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"summary\": \"A JSON-formatted message from sender ID 1 to sage requesting a list of recently promoted individuals, sent on April 13, 2025 at 13:10:21 UTC.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"summary\": \"A message from sender ID 1 to receiver ID 8 congratulating Hannah on her promotion to Deputy Manager, sent on 2025-04-13T13:08:18.948Z.
